Research base topic ,With standard and enhanced model using DNN.
# Standard model
Standard model is a model without any inhancement so in this i am using in simple DNN so the problem is to inhance the error rate and graphs of regression problem through DNN.
# Inhanced model
This model is inhanced by using sigmoid function before inputs to neurons,so by this error rate is too low and graphs are too good .
